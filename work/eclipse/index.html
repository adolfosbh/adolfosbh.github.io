<p>The main expertise I&rsquo;ve got during my professional career is focused on <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html">Java</a> and
<a href="https://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plugins development. As a result, I&rsquo;ve done several contributions to different
open source official Eclipse projects, and promoted as committer in few of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/orbit/">Eclipse Orbit</a>, main project where third party libraries are maintained as
consumable bundles for Eclipse projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdt.ocl">Eclipse OCL</a>, is an implementation of the
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/">Object Constraint Language (OCL)</a> standard for EMF-based models.</li>
<li><a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mmt.qvt-oml">Eclipse QVTo</a>, a project that provides a partial implementation of the Operational Mappings Language defined by the OMG standard specification <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/QVT/">Query/View/Transformation (QVT)</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mmt.qvtd">Eclipse QVTd</a>, a project that provides a partial implementation of the Core (QVTc) and Relations (QVTr) Languages defined by the OMG standard specification <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/QVT/">Query/View/Transformation (QVT)</a>.</li>
</ul>
